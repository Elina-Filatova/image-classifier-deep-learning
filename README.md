# Image Classifier Deep Learning ✨

Welcome to the **Image Classifier Deep Learning** project! This repository is dedicated to creating an image classification model using deep learning techniques. The classification is performed on the **Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition Dataset**. Below is a description of each notebook:

## 🔢 `training_model.ipynb`

### Description:
This notebook utilizes the following libraries and frameworks for efficient model training:
- `os`, `pathlib`, `shutil` for file and path management
- `kagglehub` for accessing datasets from Kaggle
- `pandas` for handling data in tabular format
- `fastai.vision.all` for state-of-the-art image classification workflows
- `PIL` for image processing tasks

This notebook focuses on training machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance optimization.

### Key Features:
- 🔄 **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- 🎨 **Visualization:** Charts and graphs for understanding the data.
- 🔨 **Model Training:** Implementation of deep learning algorithms.
- 🔬 **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization of model parameters.
- 🔍 **Performance Metrics:** Detailed evaluation of model performance.
- 🚀 **Deployment: Hosting on Hugging Face with Streamlit**
  - The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit**, a Python library for building interactive web applications.
  - Hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, providing an accessible and user-friendly interface for making predictions on new data.
